# MCUHell

This is a repository to consolidate different MCU compiler chains using CMake/Make tooling. Hopefully this will help live a more peaceful life and use our favorite code editors rather than getting locked into using shitty IDEs.

This repository was inspired by `/u/saltyJeff2468`'s descision to [vent](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/ixa032/a_desperate_plea_to_embedded_ide_designers/g66pylw/?context=3) to the greater community.
